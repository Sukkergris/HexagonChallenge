# HexagonChallenge
Create your own strategy to defeat others.

This game is originally designed by Danske Bank and is about creating the best algorithm for a turn based
strategy game. Each player starts with one Hexagon with 1 resource on it. Every turn a player gets one extra resource
on each owned Hexagon that's not at the 100 resource limit. The game is played for 10 minutes, and the player with the
most resources at the end wins. The game can be cut short by conquering all Hexagons.

Design your own strategy in the HexagonChallenge game by creating a class that inherits from player,
and write your algorithm in the abstract method Strategy, that has to be overridden.

When you've finished up a draft or final version, head to the Game class, and add a new instance of the class
to the player list, called players, and run the game in Unity.
